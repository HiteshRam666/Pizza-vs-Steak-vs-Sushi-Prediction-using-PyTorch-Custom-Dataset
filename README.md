## What is a custom dataset ?
A custom dataset is a collection of data relating to a specific problem you're working on.

In essence, a custom dataset can be comprised of almost anything.

For example, if we were building a food image classification app like Nutrify, our custom dataset might be images of food.

Or if we were trying to build a model to classify whether or not a text-based review on a website was positive or negative, our custom dataset might be examples of existing customer reviews and their ratings.

Or if we were trying to build a sound classification app, our custom dataset might be sound samples alongside their sample labels.

Or if we were trying to build a recommendation system for customers purchasing things on our website, our custom dataset might be examples of products other people have bought.
